## Install AutoForm's integration to your UI library

AutoForm integrates directly into your UI library to render forms. You can choose from the following official integrations:

- For Material UI: `npm install @autoform/mui`
- For Mantine: `npm install @autoform/mantine`
- For shadcn/ui: `npx shadcn@latest add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vantezzen/autoform/refs/heads/main/packages/shadcn/registry/autoform.json`
  Use `import { AutoForm } from "@/components/ui/autoform"` to import the component
- more to come...

If you want to integrate into your own UI components or another UI library, check out the [custom integration guide](/docs/react/custom-integration).

In the docs, we will use Material UI as an example but simply replace the imports with the ones from your UI library.

## Install AutoForm's integration to your schema library

- `npm install @autoform/zod` for Zod
- more to come...

## Create a form

```tsx
import { AutoForm } from "@autoform/mui";
import { ZodProvider } from "@autoform/zod";

const mySchema = z.object({
  // ...
});
const schemaProvider = new ZodProvider(mySchema);

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <AutoForm
      schema={schemaProvider}
      onSubmit={(data) => {
        console.log(data);
      }}
      withSubmit
    />
  );
}
```

</Steps>

## Next.js and RSC

AutoForm can only be used inside a client-side React component due to serialization of the schema and values to your event listeners. If you want to use it in a Next.js app, simply mark your component with "use client":

```tsx
// MyPage.tsx
export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyForm />
    </div>
  );
}

// MyForm.tsx
"use client";
import { AutoForm } from "@autoform/mui";
export default function MyForm() {
  return <AutoForm ... />;
}
```

## Accessing the form data

There are two ways to access the form data:

### onSubmit

The preferred way is to use the `onSubmit` prop. This will be called when the form is submitted and the data is valid.

```tsx
<AutoForm
  onSubmit={(data, { setError, clearForm }) => {
    // Do something with the data
    // Data is validated and coerced with zod automatically
    // You can use setError to set errors for the fields
    // You can run clearForm() to clear the form
  }}
/>
```

### Controlled form

You can also use the `values` and `setValues` props to control the form data yourself.

```tsx
const [values, setValues] = useState<Partial<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>>({});

<AutoForm values={values} setValues={setValues} />;
```

Please note that the data is not validated or coerced when using this method as they update immediately.

## Submitting the form

You can use the `withSubmit` prop to automatically add a submit button to the form.

```tsx
<AutoForm
  // ...
  withSubmit
/>
```

## Adding other elements

All children passed to the `AutoForm` component will be rendered below the form.

```tsx
<AutoForm>
  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">
    By submitting this form, you agree to our{" "}
    <a href="#" className="text-primary underline">
      terms and conditions
    </a>
    .
  </p>
</AutoForm>
```
